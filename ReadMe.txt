In the Public folder is a file called DBDApp, which is an SQL file for creating the tables for killers, killer_perks, survivors, and survivor_perks. Make sure to uncomment those out and then go into the DBD App itself and locate the large commented out sections, where the comment is related to importing in the killers and survivors. Uncomment out the code for each section as needed, run it, and once done comment out the code once more.
